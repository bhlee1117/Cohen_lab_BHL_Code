# TrackNTrace
--------------

TrackNTrace is an open source MATLAB framework for single molecule localization, tracking, and super-resolution applications written by Simon Christoph Stein and Jan Thiart from the University of Goettingen.

The software facilitates development, distribution, and comparison of methods in the community by providing a readily extendable, plugin-based system and combining it with an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI incorporates possibilities for quick inspection of localization and tracking results, giving direct feedback of the quality achieved with the chosen algorithms and parameter values, as well as possible errors, a feature neglected in most software packages available. The plugin system simplifies adapting and tailoring methods towards any research problem's individual requirements. We provide a set of plugins implementing state-of-the-art methods together with the basic program, alongside tools for common post-processing steps such as (d)STORM image generation, or drift correction.

To get started with using TrackNTrace, have a look at the PDF file inside the manual folder.
A publication introducing the TrackNTrace framework is currently in review.
