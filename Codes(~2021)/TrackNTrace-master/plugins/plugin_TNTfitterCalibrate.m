function [refinementData] = refinePositions_psfFitCeres_calibrate(img,candidatePos,options,currentFrame)
% Wrapper function for psfFit_Image function (see below). Refer to
% tooltips above and to psfFit_Image help to obtain information on input
% and output variables.
% 
% INPUT:
%     img: 2D matrix of pixel intensities, data type and normalization
%     arbitrary.
%     
%     candidatePos: 2D double row array of localization candidates created
%     by locateParticles.m. Refer to that function or to TrackNTrace manual
%     for more information.
%     
%     options: Struct of input parameters provided by GUI.
%     
% OUTPUT:
%     refinementData: 2D double array of fitted parameters
%     [x,y,A,B,sigma_x,sigma_y] used for creating calibration
%     file. Refer to locateParticles.m or to TrackNTrace manual for more
%     information.

refinementOptions.halfw = ceil(3*refinementOptions.PSFsigma);

end

function [ params ] = psfFit_Image( img, varargin )
% Short usage: params = psfFit_Image( img, param_init );
% Full usage: [ params, exitflag ] = psfFit_Image( img, param_init, param_optimizeMask, useIntegratedGauss, useMLErefine, hWinSize, global_init )
%  Fit multiple spot candidates in a given image with a gaussian point spread function model.
%
% Coordinate convention: Integer coordinates are centered in pixels. I.e.
% the position xpos=3, ypos=5 is exactly the center of pixel img(5,3). Thus
% pixel center coordinates range from 1 to size(img,2) for x and 1 to
% size(img,1) for y coordinates.
%
% Use empty matrix [] for parameters you don't want to specify.
%
% Gaussian fitting covers three basic cases:
%   - fitting isotropic gaussian  (sigma_y and angle initial values not specified and they should not be optimized)
%   - fitting anisotropic gaussian  (angle initial value not specified and should not be optimized)
%   - fitting anisotropic rotated gaussian
%
% The fitting case is selected based on the set of specified initial
% parameters together with the set of parameters that should be optimized.
% The angle input/output should be in degree.
%
% Input:
%   img        - Image to fit to. (internally converted to double)
%   param_init - Initial values PxN to fit N spot candidates in the given image with
%                initial conditions for P parameters. At least position [xpos; ypos]
%                must be specified (P>=2). You can specify up to [xpos;ypos;A;BG;sigma_x,sigma_y,angle].
%                If negative or no values are given, the fitter estimates a value for that parameter if neccessary, 
%                with the exception of the angle, which is estimated if angle==0 and if it should be optimized.
%                If parameters are not optimized (see next entry) their values are kept constant during optimization.
%   param_optimizeMask - Must be true(1)/false(0) for every parameter [xpos,ypos,A,BG,sigma_x,sigma_y,angle].
%                Parameters with value 'false' are not fitted.  | default: [1,1,1,1,1,0,0] -> 'optimize x,y,A,BG,sigma' (isoptric gaussian)
%   useIntegratedGauss - Wether to use pixel integrated gaussian or not 
%                  not supported for non-isotropic arbitrarily roated gaussians | default: false
%   useMLErefine - Use Poissonian noise based maximum likelihood estimation after
%                  least squares fit. Make sure to input image intensities in photons
%                  for this to make sense. | default: false
%   hWinSize   - Each candidates fit takes intensites in a window of (2*hWinsize+1)x(2*hWinsize+1) into account | default: 5
%   global_init - For convenience (up to) [sigma_x,sigma_y,angle] can also be given as an extra parameter.
%               This simply sets all candidates initial values, eventually overwriting their param_init values.
%
% Output
%   params     -  Fitted parameters 8xN. Columns are in order
%                 [xpos,ypos,A,BG,sigma_x,sigma_y,angle; exitflag].
%
%           The last row 'exitflag' returns the state of optimizer.
%           Positive = 'good'. Negative = 'bad'.

% This function creates a calibration Table [z,sigma_x/sigma_y] from an
% astigmatic calibration movie where a number of diffraction-limited
% fluorescent emitters was recorded at different axial positions with a
% scanning stage.
% 
% It's assumed that drastic outliers (particles in focus before stage moves
% to defocused position) were removed by editing the movie beforehand and
% that the z-stage moves smoothly at linear intervals from a position below
% (or above) the focus to another position above (or below) the focus.
% Parts of the curve where the aspect ratio gradually saturates (derivative
% close to 0) are removed from the smoothed interpolation curve.
% 
% The functions fits a polynom of 4th degree to the aspect ratio
% (sigma_x/sigma_y)(z) and also finds the midpoint z-pixel where the aspect
% ratio is equal to 1. A smooth interpolation curve with a resolution of
% 0.1 z-pixels is calculated and everything's saved to a calibration file
