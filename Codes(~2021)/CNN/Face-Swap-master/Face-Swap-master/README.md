# Face Swapping algorithm

We have implemented an automatic
face swapping algorithm that searches and selects faces within an
image and replaces them with another face with realistic results.
Our algorithm identifies and uses the most suitable faces using a
selection process, face extraction using optimal seam search, and
blending using linear RGB channel scaling and Poisson Editing.

For more information you can refer to the report over [here][1].
